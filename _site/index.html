      <p>I started my career in IT security after obtaining a B.S. and M.S. in Cognitive Science from UT Dallas. I worked in a Security Operations Center (SOC) for an MSSP monitoring security appliances and performing PCI compliance reporting for about a year before returning to school at SMU Guildhall to pursue a professional certificate in game programming.</p>

<p>Following my graduation from Guildhall, I worked for a startup on a variety of projects, including a multiplayer augmented reality defense-shooter game, automated web application testing via UI and API, and cloud infrastructure codification and deployment of the aforementioned web application. Near the end of my time at the startup I had developed an interest in broader software development (not just games) and how to leverage the cloud.</p>

<p>I obtained my first AWS certification and then, with a background in security and software development, took on my current role in security engineering.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Seek/Flee calculates a vector to the target and accelerates in that direction (the negative of that direction in the case of Flee).</li>
  <li>Arrive, which is essentially a variant of Seek, has a radius around the target within which it throttles its velocity (proportional to the distance to the target) so that it comes to a nice smooth stop instead of overshooting like Seek does</li>
  <li>Path Follow picks targets along a path and calculates a vector to the current target along the path and accelerates in that direction. Once the agent is within a certain radius of the target point the next point along the path is set as the current target for the behavior</li>
  <li>Wander has a circle centered a certain distance out along the forward vector of the agent. The agent picks a random point along the outer edge of this circle to accelerate toward to produce a meandering behavior</li>
  <li>Pursue/Evade is similar to Seek/Flee but instead of calculating a vector to the target to accelerate to it calculates a vector to a predicted position of the target after a certain amount of time to move toward (move away from in the case of Evade). This results in a more aggressive seeking behavior than Seek itself</li>
